Code and data for the manuscript "Tidal  ventilation induces divergent repair responses in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts mediated by IL-6  signalling"
The folder contains the following files:

- "Lung_repair.R": R script used to load and process all the data files described below. All the analyses and figures shown in the manuscript are generated with this script.
  
- "Wound_healing_BEAS.xlsx": Raw data used to quantify the wound healing assay in BEAS-2B cells supplemented with BALF from MV or CPAP patients.
  
- "Transcripts_BEAS_github.rds": Count matrix from BEAS-2B RNA-seq samples supplemented with BALF from MV or CPAP patients.
  
- "Wound_healing_MRC5.xlsx": Raw data used to quantify the wound healing assay in MRC5 cells supplemented with BALF from MV or CPAP patients.
  
- "Transcripts_MRC5_github.rds": count matrix from BEAS-2B RNA-seq samples supplemented with BALF from MV or CPAP patients.
  
- "Wound_healing_BEAS_toci.xlsx": Raw data used to quantify the wound healing assay in BEAS-2B cells with BALF from MV or CPAP patients treated with tocilizumab.
  
- "Transcripts_BEAS_toci_github.rds": Count matrix from BEAS-2B RNA-seq samples supplemented with BALF from MV or CPAP patients trated with tocilizumab.
  
- "Wound_healing_MRC5_toci.xlsx": Raw data used to quantify the wound healing assay in MRC5 cells with BALF from MV or CPAP patients treated with tocilizumab.
  
- "Transcripts_MRC5_toci_github.rds": Count matrix from BEAS-2B RNA-seq samples supplemented with BALF from MV or CPAP patients treated with tocilizumab.
  
- "Proteomics_BALF_github.rds": Protein abundance matrix obtained from BALF proteomic analysis from patients under MV or CPAP.
  
- "qPCR_BEAS_CsA": Raw qPCR data from IL-6 and PPIA relative expression in BEAS-2B cell line supplemented with BALF from MV or CPAP patients treated with cyclosporine-A (CsA).
